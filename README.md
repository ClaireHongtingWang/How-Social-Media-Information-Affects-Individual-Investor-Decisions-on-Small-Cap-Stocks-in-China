How Social Media Information Affects Individual Investor Decisions: Based on Small-Cap Stocks in China’s Stock Market  

Empirical project about Machine Learning and Casual Inference (using Python)

# 1.	Overview
This project I took in Big Data Econometrics in my postgraduate studies at the University of Southern California in 2021 Fall. 

# 2.	Background & Project Goal
The stock market has received wide attention around the world due to its excellent reflection on how well the economy is doing.  The reason we choose Small-Cap stocks is the system of individual investors can explain the common changes in the returns of stocks with a high concentration of retail investors especially when these stocks have arbitrage costs, the changes in the returns of such stocks are more significant. Meanwhile, a growing body of results has recognized that social media based on IT platforms are bringing the creators of crowdfunding information closer than ever to potential investors. We intend to figure out how social media information affects individual investors’ decisions in China’s stock market.

# 3.	Data Sources
The project uses a web crawler as the tool and collects data from the financial website. The research objectives are small-cap stocks in China’s stocks market, so our data focus on the stocks whose market value is less than three billion. We are interested in the fluctuations of the stock price, so we take annualized volatility as a standard to choose the stocks. By applying these methods, we finally choose 87 small-cap stocks in China’s stocks market as our research objects.

# 4.	Methodology
TF-IDF  
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  

# 5. Codes Explaination
Data collection.py: Web crawler.  
TF_IDF.py: The frequency of each word.  
LDA.ipynb: Explain why some parts of the data are similar.
